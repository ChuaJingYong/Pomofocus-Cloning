# Pomofocus-Cloning

For those who are here from watching the recorded video, it is highly recommended to just use 3 main files and follow along with the video to maximize your learning experience.

### Semi-completed folder
Contains the "completed" files for you refer to after watching the video

### Fully-completed folder
Contains the optimized completed files, without the additional CSS files and HTML pages. Completed features includes smooth switching between modes

## Improvement features to add on
1. Replicate the features found in the pop-up setting menu in Pomofocus.io (such as adjustable default time for different modes, choice of default sounds for users to choose from etc.)
2. Integrate ChartJS to show recorded pattern of the user over a period of time
3. Integrate Firebase Authentication and Firestore to authenticate registered users only and record their stats for the chart to display
